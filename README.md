# ClosetOS

**ClosetOS** is a full-stack fashion intelligence platform that helps users organize their wardrobe, generate outfits, and gain insights into their personal style using rule-based logic and optional AI.

> It focuses on **what you already own**, not what you should buy.

## 🚀 Project Status

🟡 **Early Development (MVP in progress)**

This project is being built incrementally using a **prompt-driven, AI-assisted development workflow**, where each feature is implemented, tested, and verified step by step.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build a **non-generic fashion/clothing application**
- Demonstrate **real-world full-stack engineering skills**
- Use AI **intentionally**, not everywhere
- Operate fully on **free or open-source tooling**
- Design with **scalability and cost constraints** in mind

- Provide insights into personal style patterns
- Learn preferences over time via feedback
